They are sophisticated in maneuvering power, making false accusations, double standards, show off ideology, create chaos, and launch massive wars. They believe in money and power, and they have no reverence for life and God. We hope that Witch Pelosi will stop telling lies and let us know the truth, we want the world to be free from war and hunger, we want love and peace.`,
